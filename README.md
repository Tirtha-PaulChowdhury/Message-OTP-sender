# Message-OTP-sender

This is a mini project on python focused on sending text messages/OTP to any mobile number.

I have used here the Fast2SMS API to send text messages.
As it is a free service and I have opted for promotional text, the messages will only be delivered between 9AM to 9PM.
For sending OTP we will use flash messaging service and for normal text message we will use the normal text message feature.
